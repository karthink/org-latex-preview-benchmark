* Test suite for org latex preview regression

Thrown together testing setup for Org 9.7's =org-latex-preview=, which is inexplicably 40% $slower with TeXLive 2023 compared to TeXLive 2022.

To run:

- Navigate to =texlive-2022/= in a shell and run =nix develop=.
- Once it's ready, launch Emacs from here. (Or =emacs -q= if necessary)
- Make sure you can access Org 9.7, install it if necessary.
- =(load-file "test-olp.el")=  (Sets up utility functions and a local =org-persist-directory=)
- Open an Org file in =test-org=
- Precompile in the buffer if you don't want to benchmark precompilation times
- Run =M-x my-org-latex-preview-benchmark=, bound to =C-c b= in Org.
- Check =M-x elp-results= or feed =etrace.json= (in the =texlive-2022= dir) to a flame graph analyzer.
- Repeat all steps in the =texlive-2023= dir.
